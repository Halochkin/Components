1. Why change and input events occurs on input (type="text")?

    1.a change event
        For <input type="text">, the change event doesn't fire until the control loses focus,
        i.e. after onblur event if the value has changed.
        For example, while you are typing something in the text field below, there is no event.
        But as soon as you move the focus to another element, for example, press a button,
        the on exchange event will occur.

    1.b input event
        An oninput event is similar to an onchange event , the difference is that an oninput
        event occurs immediately after the item's value has changed and an onchange event occurs
        when the item loses focus after the content has been changed.
        Input event data - the string containing the data that has been added to the element,
        which MAY be the empty string if the content has been deleted.
-->
<input id="input" type="text" size="30" placeholder="type in something to fire input event">
<input type="button" value="Just a button which activate change event">
<p id="output"></p>
<script>
  let InputElement = document.querySelector("#input");
  let spanElement = document.querySelector("#output");

  InputElement.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
    e.target.style.border = "3px solid green";
    console.log("change");
    alert("Text has been changed");
  });

  InputElement.addEventListener("blur", () => {
    console.log("blur");
  });

  InputElement.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
    e.target.style.border = "2px solid orange";
    console.log("input");
    updateValue(e);
  });

  function updateValue(e) {
    spanElement.innerText = e.target.value;
  }

</script>

2. Which event came first?

    According to the demo above, event sequence will be next:
                    input
                      |
                    change
                      |
                     blur

3. Why browser adds change event if it already has input event?

    The change event occurs at the end of the input element value change when this change is fixed.
    The input event is fired every time the value of the element changes. This is unlike the change
    event, which only fires when the value is committed, such as by pressing the enter key, selecting
    a value from a list of options, and the like.
