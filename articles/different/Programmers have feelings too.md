# Programmers have feeling too

In the context of emotions programming stands apart from other professions. In the process of working even a high-class developer inevitably have errors that deliver literally physical pain. If by the end of the working day it was not possible to solve the problem, then this pain will accompany him all evening and until the morning of the next day, when he will take up the case with renewed vigor.
 
If in the process of programming you absolutely nothing happens, do not try to break through by force to the goal. Once you get frustrated, angry, or bored in the process of finding mistakes, or succumb to superstitious ideas, you can very easily do more damage than the original problem. 

>When I was 16 years old, I like all the guys of my age had to pass a medical examination in the military, despite the fact that only adults can be called to serve in the army.<br>
This is done because at 16, the future recruit is still inexperienced and goes to the draft board without preparing separate certificates of disability from childhood or incurable diseases incompatible with military service, he is immediately marked as completely healthy.<br>
At 9 in the morning it all started. We were told to hang the jackets on the hooks and get all the documents. After that, a 2-hour bureaucratic red tape began with the establishment of personal affairs, surveys, questionnaires and filling in boring psychological tests.<br>
Since I knew from childhood that he did not want to be in the army, the idea that I was rejected firmly rooted in my mind. <br>
`The main task of doctors of the military enlistment office is to determine whether a young man is fit for military service . In this case, doctors have no right to diagnose. They have the right only to register the disease: to conduct a visual examination, interview the recruit and study his medical documents.`<br>
After seeing almost all the doctors, I realized with horror that I was fit for service in the army, and most likely the last doctor will confirm my guess. That doctor was a therapist.<br>
`"Nervous often?"`- asked me a woman doctor, about 60 years of age.<br>
`"Yes,"` - I said. <br>
Her face didn't express any emotion, she slightly raised an eyebrow, and said, `"psychopaths in the army are not needed."`<br>
All my thoughts stopped. Well, I'm not fit to be in the army, that's easy. I already imagined how I would be given a certificate that I do not fit and I will never be drafted into the army!!!<br>
But it was only my dreams. If you read carefully, I have already said that the doctors in the military have no right to diagnose...<br> And instead of closing the issue with the military enlistment office, I was examined for several days in a mental hospital. I drew pictures, solved tests and did many other boring things. 2 days later I was found perfectly healthy.<br>
It was a great life lesson that teaches you not to complicate your own life.

Learning new things is a long process, and it is possible that you have the feeling that in your case it lasts even longer than usual. But moving forward at snail's speed is still better than no code at all, and bad code is a natural and fun (many say: the only) path to good code.

### 5 tips on how to redirect anger from destructive to constructive direction

#### 1. Switch to other tasks not related to your code
 
 Anger is a good emotional state to find faults in others code. Incredibly, it is so. You are "ready to blame the other". You are thinking "how will they hurt me". How are they running away from their responsibility to me, the team? It is not a good emotion for a "full review" of others code, but it can  highlight problems that a "rational mind" would not manage to see. It is not a good state to find faults in your own code.
 
 #### 2. Use this as a kick in the ass to finish the actual tasks
 
 You get forceful, aggressive, fast, decisive, positive towards your own ideas. You get forceful, aggressive, fast, decisive, NEGATIVE towards others ideas.
 
 #### 3. Uncontrollable anger controls you
 
 Sometimes, it should be used intentionally. To have "code quarrels" when they naturally arise (I don't believe in self-starting angry feelings is good) can be twice as good to solve some tasks. But anger should ALWAYS be observed and controlled, everyone should know and expect and rest assured that tomorrow the angry one will see things differently. The anger is a tool, for all parties in a code quarrel. But it should never be misunderstood as the "truth" or the right perspective. It is just one perspective that adds value to the process and result for all parties. 
I know this about you and anger. I have it on my sketchpad to help you get safe and secure in this side of your own person.
Anger is ok. But be brave while angry, manage to also find the faults on your own side while you *stay* angry. Don't be either rational or angry, be both angry and rational.

#### 4. [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) has not been repealed

In our case, it can be interpreted as the fact that suffering will necessarily accompany the beginning of the learning process. That's normal. But you can form some kind of "immunity" if you take it for granted.For this reason, crowds of newcomers break off when trying to "enter IT" â€” they simply can not withstand the pain of daily, hourly, almost every minute failures. Therefore, there is a chance only for those who "have a flame in their eyes", which as if under the influence of adrenaline rush into the maelstrom of programming, without being distracted by pain. But the action of "adrenaline" is temporary, so such a person can extinguish the fire in his eyes, if after six months, he will not see the result of his work. Fortunately, this book will allow you to see the result of learning much faster.

#### 5. Anger is not as destructive as sadness

The Daily Mail published an [article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2815719/Feeling-sad-FIVE-DAYS-shift-mood-Sadness-lasts-240-times-longer-emotions-study-claims.html) that sadness lasts 240 times longer than the other 27 emotions that scientists have researched.
To test the duration and strength of emotions, researchers at the University of Belgium asked 233 students to recall recent emotional episodes and report on their duration. Also, the survey participants had to report how they cope with their emotions. With 27 emotions, the students responded, sadness lasted longer, while shame, surprise, disgust, boredom, irritation and a sense of relief passed faster.
On average, it takes 120 hours to get rid of sadness, but only 30 minutes to survive disgust or shame. Anger lasts an average of 60 hours, and joy-35 hours.

In this regard, we can say that programming in addition to the useful skill of cast-iron ass also sucks "patience on the way to the goal" and the skill of emotionless solutions to complex life problems.
