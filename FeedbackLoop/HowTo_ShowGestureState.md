# HowTo: ShowGestureState

Some critics find gestures to be difficult to understand and therefore useless. At the same time, gesture technologies 
are being mastered at a rapid pace, and the world of UI tactile solutions have been put on stream. But still, the main
 difficulty is novelty. Gestures as a way to control electronic devices appeared in the early 80's, and from the 
 beginning of zero they spread everywhere. Designers are trying to make gestures intuitive - but this process is still 
 at the testing stage.
 Gesture-based input is becoming increasingly important because of the increasing need for devices capable of supporting
  complex, continuous interaction in a range of contexts. However, gesture recognition technologies are not perfect;
   particularly in the circumstances where they would be most useful, such as with portable devices, on the move. 
  Disturbances to the inputs from walking or moving and inaccuracy caused by noisy sensors can cause even the best of 
   extant recognition systems to fail. Variation in performance is also normal, as each gesture from the same person will 
   vary, different users will have individual gesturing styles, and furthermore these are all subject to change in 
   different contexts, such as changing activities or emotional states. Some of the accuracy limitations of gesture 
   recognition systems can be overcome by providing feedback to the user, making the recognition process less opaque. 
   Many conventional systems can provide sound or vibrational summative feedback on the completion of a gesture, 
   allowing the user to identify any potential errors. However, dynamic, continuous feedback during the gesture allows 
   the user to respond to the system in real-time. This avoids repetition, and can help the user understand where errors 
   or deviations are occuring in the gesture performance. It also allows users to gain insight into how the system 
   interprets their movements.
 
A standard set of gestures for most applications:

- Click (or tap)
- Swipe.
- Double stage.
- Drag and drop
- A pinch.
- Long press
- Screen rotation

You can't always guess that these gestures are there without a clue. Hence the question: how intuitive are gesture interfaces?

Touchscreen interfaces only seem simple and understandable when interaction with digital elements is close to physical 
action. Tactile feedback and manipulations on the screen should be appropriate.

 There are several ways to display gesture states: 

* One of the most effective methods is step-by-step disclosure: gestures and other controls become available as you 
become familiar with the interface. To begin with, the most important controls are shown - with the help of visual
 prompts, or introductory instruction. The first looks more preferable as the majority of users at once pass to business
  and does not waste time for instructions.

* Visual hints and animation which react to a touch of the screen can be appropriate. As an example, the function "slide 
to unlock", which was previously present in Apple devices.
* Word hint; arrow indicates direction; animation is a feedback function.
* Short-term activation of vibration to signal the successful completion of the gesture.

People perform certain actions with minimal interference from the developer. Feedback simplifies interaction with the
 application. Thus, a habit is formed. Thus the user learns to cope with more complex operations in the application.
The habit formation process includes three steps:
Trigger - prompts you to take action (for example: notifications remind you of something). 
Action - the user receives a hint on how to achieve a certain goal. 
Feedback is a kind of reward for work.
