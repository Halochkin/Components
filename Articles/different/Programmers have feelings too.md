# Programmers have feeling too

In the context of emotions programming stands apart from other professions. In the process of working even a high-class developer inevitably have errors that deliver literally physical pain. If by the end of the working day it was not possible to solve the problem, then this pain will accompany him all evening and until the morning of the next day, when he will take up the case with renewed vigor.
 
If in the process of programming you absolutely nothing happens, do not try to break through by force to the goal. Once you get frustrated, angry, or bored in the process of finding mistakes, or succumb to superstitious ideas, you can very easily do more damage than the original problem.

Learning new things is a long process, and it is possible that you have the feeling that in your case it lasts even longer than usual. But moving forward at snail's speed is still better than no code at all, and bad code is a natural and fun (many say: the only) path to good code.

### 5 tips on how to redirect anger from destructive to constructive direction

#### 1. Switch to other tasks not related to your code
 
 Anger is a good emotional state to find faults in others code. Incredibly, it is so. You are "ready to blame the other". You are thinking "how will they hurt me". How are they running away from their responsibility to me, the team? It is not a good emotion for a "full review" of others code, but it can  highlight problems that a "rational mind" would not manage to see. It is not a good state to find faults in your own code.
 
 #### 2. Use this as a kick in the ass to finish the actual tasks
 
 You get forceful, aggressive, fast, decisive, positive towards your own ideas. You get forceful, aggressive, fast, decisive, NEGATIVE towards others ideas.
 
 #### 3. Uncontrollable anger controls you
 
 Sometimes, it should be used intentionally. To have "code quarrels" when they naturally arise (I don't believe in self-starting angry feelings is good) can be twice as good to solve some tasks. But anger should ALWAYS be observed and controlled, everyone should know and expect and rest assured that tomorrow the angry one will see things differently. The anger is a tool, for all parties in a code quarrel. But it should never be misunderstood as the "truth" or the right perspective. It is just one perspective that adds value to the process and result for all parties. 
I know this about you and anger. I have it on my sketchpad to help you get safe and secure in this side of your own person.
Anger is ok. But be brave while angry, manage to also find the faults on your own side while you *stay* angry. Don't be either rational or angry, be both angry and rational.

#### 4. [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) has not been repealed

In our case, it can be interpreted as the fact that suffering will necessarily accompany the beginning of the learning process. That's normal. But you can form some kind of "immunity" if you take it for granted.For this reason, crowds of newcomers break off when trying to "enter IT" â€” they simply can not withstand the pain of daily, hourly, almost every minute failures. Therefore, there is a chance only for those who "have a flame in their eyes", which as if under the influence of adrenaline rush into the maelstrom of programming, without being distracted by pain. But the action of "adrenaline" is temporary, so such a person can extinguish the fire in his eyes, if after six months, he will not see the result of his work. Fortunately, this book will allow you to see the result of learning much faster.

#### 5. Anger is not as destructive as sadness

The Daily Mail published an [article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2815719/Feeling-sad-FIVE-DAYS-shift-mood-Sadness-lasts-240-times-longer-emotions-study-claims.html) that sadness lasts 240 times longer than the other 27 emotions that scientists have researched.
To test the duration and strength of emotions, researchers at the University of Belgium asked 233 students to recall recent emotional episodes and report on their duration. Also, the survey participants had to report how they cope with their emotions. With 27 emotions, the students responded, sadness lasted longer, while shame, surprise, disgust, boredom, irritation and a sense of relief passed faster.
On average, it takes 120 hours to get rid of sadness, but only 30 minutes to survive disgust or shame. Anger lasts an average of 60 hours, and joy-35 hours.

In this regard, we can say that programming in addition to the useful skill of cast-iron ass also sucks "patience on the way to the goal" and the skill of emotionless solutions to complex life problems.
