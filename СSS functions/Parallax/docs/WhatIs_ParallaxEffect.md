# WhatIs: ParallaxEffect


`Parallax`  - this is a change in the visible position of the object in relation to the remote background, depending 
on the location of the observer. 
In web design, the parallax effect or parallax scrolling is a special technique where the background image moves slower
 in perspective than the foreground elements. This technology is used more and more often because it looks really cool 
 and cool.

Parallax effect is used not only in navigation scrolling, but also in creating decorative effects that do not require
 moving around the page. Yes, and actually scrolling is not limited to vertical scrolling in a straight line: it often 
 has a different direction, is widely combined with the scaling and change of elements during the movement, with the 
 movement of elements on different trajectories.

This three-dimensional effect is achieved by means of several layers overlapping and moving at different speeds when 
scrolling. By means of such technology it is possible to create not only artificial three-dimensional effect, it is 
possible to apply it to icons, images and other elements of page.

### Perception of parallax effect

Another issue related to parallax-scrolling in web design - how does the use of this effect affect the user's perception
 of the site. Often, even if the technology works correctly on the site, many users recognize that the dynamic and 
 "three-dimensional" scrolling rather irritates them and prevents them from perceiving the content of the page.

The combination of complexity of technical implementation and demanding resources with ambiguity of assessment by users 
and apparent redundancy prevents the penetration of technology into the broader context of web development - parallax
 remains effective and creative, but not everywhere appropriate "design solution". The most adequate field of application
  of parallax scrolling remains single-page promo-sites containing a small amount of content and needing to create a
   memorable external image.

 

### Advantages of the parallax effect 

 #### Sensitive pathway
Parallax and especially the scrolling effect of parallax can do a lot of things and, in particular, can have a strong 
effect on the emotions of visitors.  For example, the effect allows the viewer to be guided through the history or on 
the time scale. You can not just see the parallax, but interact with it, with the site as a whole, see the calculation 
of altitude above sea level, look beyond the mountain ranges by moving the cursor and more.

#### When design matters
Such a solution is perfect for so-called one-page sites and resources that provide a minimum of information, such as
 only a description of activities or contacts and location. When using parallax scrolling site even with a small amount
  of content will be bright, attracting attention and causing interest.
In addition, the game with three-dimensional space in which the visitor gets, not only will be remembered, but also will
 help to stand out among the competitors.

### Disadvantages of the parallax effect 

#### Preload images
The more parallax you have on the site, the more images you need. The more images (of high quality) and large size, the
 longer the site is loaded on the user's side. In order not to overload neither the site, nor the traffic to the visitor 
 is more convenient to initially provide the loading of images, and then allow the script to perform the animation effect.
  This means that the user will have to wait for some time. It is important to note that the user should not think that 
  your site does not work. Therefore, in such cases it is very important to add a progress bar to the download.

#### Mobility
Every year users increasingly use mobile devices.  But the parallax effect, which is created by scrolling the page, does 
not work on them. Therefore, you will have to create an alternative option or abandon the idea. For example, some sites
 simply do not display the necessary graphic information or do not open at all, when 
the usual browser on the PC or tablet, everything will work.

Parallax effect and parallax-scrolling will be popular in web design for a considerable amount of time. What exactly 
to use - to decide the webmaster and the customer. But anyway, to use the ready-made parallax-animation is always 
convenient and possible, because the attention of visitors attracts the effect and causes no less impression than a 
normal photo.

The main thing is to imagine and understand the essence of the effect; to understand what "parallax" means and how it 
is realized. Then it remains to decompose the objects into layers and set the desired speed for the objects. Which one 
and how? The designer's fantasy is back in business. Another variant of design style, which simply makes webmasters 
fantasize and play with speeds, objects, effects.
