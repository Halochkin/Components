# WhatIs: Vibation Feedback


One of the problems when using web applications on touch-screen devices is that they do not provide tactile feedback to 
the user.

Audio feedback is one way of giving the user semantic information about the object he or she is touching.
The screen. For example, headphones allow the user to move around by telling the user which menu item he or she chooses. 
However, audio feedback is not always a suitable form of feedback.
This is because the user may want to interact with applications in silence.
An alternative way to provide tactile feedback on touchscreen devices has been to use tactile vibration

When the user touches objects on the screen, such as a button, a web link or a line list item, the vibration motor built
 into the unit is activated. This helps the user to understand whether or not it touches an object. 
However, unlike auditory feedback, this basic form of tactile feedback does not help the user to identify the object they
 are touching. Although different vibration patterns (e.g. different rhythms or different force levels) may be used to 
 transmit some semantic information

Touch-screen devices do not have the necessary information due to the lack of tactile feedback. In The feeling and touch
 of the image volume at the moment of tactile contact with the surface of a solid smooth screen is created by the 
 vibration of the surface with different amplitudes.
