 #### Types of parallax effect
  There are several basic parallax effect scenarios: 
  
  1. `Live photo (2.5D effect)`
A technique that creates a three-dimensional effect on images. It displays depth, different motion planes or even animated
particles or light effects. This is what happens when you create the illusion of depth with completely flat, 
two-dimensional objects, moving another background and foreground elements at different speeds. The foreground objects
move faster, the middle of the ground slower, and the removed background elements slower.

  2. `Background parallax` 
The most popular use of the paralax effect is the background parallax effect.
The idea is that when you scroll, the background moves slower, while the rest of the content moves normally. As a result,
the illusion creates the impression that the static area opens and then closes the image.

   4. `Scroll paralax`
   Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where background images throughout a web
 page move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional site.
 
 The idea is that the background images move more slowly relative to the virtual camera than the foreground images, 
 which creates the illusion of two-dimensional depth of the scene. Parallax scrolling can be both standard, vertical 
 and horizontal, and with a changing direction. 3. mouse parallax The mouse parallax effect is based on the position 
 of the mouse cursor in the area of the slider. This creates an illusion of depth for the layers visible on the current 
 slide. For example, your cursor enters the slider and the layers begin to move relative to the cursor.
