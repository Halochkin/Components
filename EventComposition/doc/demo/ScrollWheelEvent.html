1.Why scroll and wheel events occurs?

    1.a wheel
        Fires when a mouse wheel has been rotated around any axis, or when an equivalent input device (such as a mouse-ball,
        certain tablets or touchpads, etc.) has emulated such an action.
        The typical default action of the wheel event type is to scroll (or in some cases, zoom) the document by the
        indicated amount.
        Wheel events fires BEFORE scroll event and default action.
    1.b scroll
        Fires when the user scrolls an element by any means (arrow keys, scrollbar or mouse wheel). You cannot prevent the
        scrolling.

      The demo below shows that:
       - activation of 1 event wheel activates 12 scroll events;
       - 1 wheel event scrolls element to 100px;
       - 1 scroll event scrolls elements from 1 to 14 px. BUT sum of 12 scroll events (which occurs per one
       wheel event) = 100px as described above.

<style>
    #outer {
        height: 500px;
        width: 200px;
        overflow-y: scroll;
    }

    #inner {
        height: 1000px;
        width: 180px;
        background-color: aquamarine;
    }

    body {
        margin: 0
    }

</style>
<div id="outer">
    <div id="inner">Hello</div>
</div>

<script>
  let outer = document.querySelector("#outer");
  let inner = document.querySelector("#inner");
  let initialScroll = 0;
  let initialWheel = 0;
  let scrollEvCounter = 0;
  let wheelEvCounter = 0;


  function log(initial, e) {
    let pos = inner.getBoundingClientRect().top;
    let counter = e.type === "scroll" ? scrollEvCounter++ : wheelEvCounter++;
    let previous = e.type === "scroll" ? initialScroll : initialWheel;

    counter++;
    console.log(counter + " times " + e.type + " event and " + (previous - pos).toFixed(0) + "px per event " + (pos * -1).toFixed(0) + " from start");
    initialScroll = pos;
    initialWheel = pos;

  }

  outer.addEventListener("wheel", function (e) {
    log(initialWheel, e);
  });

  outer.addEventListener("scroll", function (e) {
    log(initialScroll, e);
  });

</script>

2. Which event came first?

    According to the demo above, event sequence will be next:
                    wheel
                      |
                    scroll
3.
