# Responsive layout

Responsive web design is the scaling of the interface to the user's device using `media-queries`, or the CSS3 module, 
which allows us to set different styles (or even style sheets) depending on the resolution of the screen, its size and 
other characteristics.

This method is better suited for sites with a flexible, or "rubber" structure. Otherwise, developers will spend a lot of
time and resources on remodeling the site for tablets and mobile phones to compensate for the lack of flexibility.
