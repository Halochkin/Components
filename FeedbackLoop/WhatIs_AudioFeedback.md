# WhatIs: Audio feedback.

Smartphones can provide not only visual but also audio feedback regarding the user's interaction with the web application. 
Audio is an obvious way to present gesture information, given the context in which gesture recognition can be useful. 
It can be used to represent voluminous, dynamic data, and is suitable for use where the eyes can be occupied - either 
with other visual displays or with other tasks such as walking with mobile devices. 

Audio feedback can be the result:
* Clicking the event over the control
* Menu navigation events
* application status updates
* sending or receiving alerts
* Alert you when you get a new message
* confirmation of activation of some functionality

An example of a common audio feedback is the output of a "click" sound in response to user input via the virtual 
keyboard. For example, a "click" sound may also signal to the user that he or she is receiving an interaction with the
 application (button press, scroll action, etc.).
The popularity of audio interfaces has increased recently. For example, audio feedback can provide audio feedback data 
instead of, or in addition to, visual feedback to transfer information and content to the user. For example, if you use 
a navigator and it corrects your route with audio messages, allowing you to stay focused on your driving.
These methods can also be used to output different sounds for different keys, sounds depending on where the key is pressed,
sounds that come from the key being pressed, volume adjustments in, and adjustments depending on how hard the key is
 pressed to support the themes the user selects for different sounds, 
Sounds may differ depending on the activation of a certain functionality or may be a signal for successful or unsuccessful 
activation of some functionality. 
Thus, audio feedback methods can support many functionalities for various input devices, such as physical buttons, 
virtual keyboards, audio alerts, displaying success or failure of a server request and others.
