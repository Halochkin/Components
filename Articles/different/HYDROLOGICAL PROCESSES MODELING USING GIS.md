 Keywords: hydrological modeling; HEC-RAS; flooding; hydrology; unmanned aerial vehicles; digital elevation model.

## Research goal

Periodic spring or summer floods and floodings on one of the largest rivers of Ukraine Dniester cause significant economic losses and social tension in the region. Therefore, flood prevention and warning the population about the destructive consequences is part of the state policy.

Hydrological modeling using GIS allows researchers? to prevent the population and civil servants to possible losses caused by floods and flooding events by assessing the risk of flooding and reduce the risks of this cataclysm.?? The studies simulate the Dniester river flooding between town Sambor and village Khatki in Lviv region. The investigated area is characterized by a complex winding shape of the channel, its significant meandering and planned displacements, which were investigated on the basis of topographic maps and satellite images from the last 70 years.

## Methodology and research scope 

The method of investigation of flooded areas as a result of water rise to a certain level has been processed?. It includes:

•	survey of the area with UAVs;
•	the implementation? of geodetic and hydrological activities in the field of research;
•	creation of DEM based on survey results and analysis of its accuracy;
•	hydrological modeling using the HEC-RAS software package;
•	determination of flood areas.

In order to obtain a digital elevation model, which is the basis for hydrological modeling, a Trimble UX5 UAV with a Sony NEX-5R camera was used to film the area. To accurately determine DEM coordinates, a standard error for planned coordinates of 6 cm was established; high-altitude coordinates depending on the basis of shooting and the underlying surface – 0,21 – 0,32m.? The DEM was created using the specialized software Pix4D.

GPS data was given as input to the hydrological modeling. The primary objective of the hydrological modeling was a) to determine the geodetic coordinates of the terrain points for the construction of the DEM in a real? coordinate system, b) estimate the accuracy of the DEM and measure the depths of the channel in the modulated part of the river, which in turn were used to describe the bottom relief. Information about the water flow rate is obtained on hydrographs.

The hydrological information of water flow is calculated? using a) graphs or tables with the data dependencies of the water flow from the absolute elevation, b) the coefficients of the underlying surface roughness, and c) the coefficient of the level of slope of the bed.

#### Highlight of results.

The data for hydrological modeling in HEC-RAS was prepared using ArcMap 10.1 GIS and HEC-GeoRAS utility. HEC-GeoRAS is a set of tools for processing geospatial data in the ArcGIS environment.

The software package HEC-RAS is based on a one-dimensional model. The main way of calculation is based on the solution of the flow energy equation, in which energy losses are due to friction and the narrowing or expansion of the river bed is estimated. The 1-dimensional Saint-Venant equation is used to calculate the unstated flow with the finite difference method. The equation follows a numerical method in which the input data are the cross-sectional lines. To ensure the accuracy of the simulation, their interval should not exceed 100 meters. In our study, this parameter is 50 meters.

The construction of cross-section lines must meet a number of requirements. The curves in the riverbed complicates this procedure more than is the case with a straight channel.

The equation of continuity, energy and flow resistance is used for modeling. The continuity equation is described by a constant and continuous period of time. The flow energy equation reflects the total energy of the flow that can be defined as the total water pressure at any point along the entire simulated riverbed. The flow resistance equation is based on the Manning equation, which contains data on the average roughness along the entire perimeter of the flow in the considered section of the channel.
A hydrological model for water flow rates with three levels of elevation (1, 2, 3m) was created.

#### Main conclusions.

•	The DEM was created according to the results of removal? from the UAV to the average quadratic error of 0.2 m.
•	The technique of hydrological modeling implemented on the part of the Dniester river with a complex configuration of the channel is processed.
•	Flooded areas at three different flood levels have been identified. 

1.  Verbs. Find the weak/general verbs, and try to be more precise and specific and strong and bold and brave in your choice of verb.
2. Look at sentences with a big head. If you have many many words before the verb, try to either split the sentence, or simplify the head.
3. In a forreign language, prepositions are different. Ukrainian Prepositions are idiosynchratic. And so are english prepositions. Try to split up your sentences instead of using long preposition sequences.
