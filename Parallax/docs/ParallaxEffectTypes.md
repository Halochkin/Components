 #### Types of parallax effect
  There are several basic parallax effect scenarios: 
  
  1. `Parallax photo`
This method is a pan and zoom effect that is used to create some kind of video from still images. Zooming and 
panning in photos creates a sense of movement that allows the viewer to be visually active.
  
  
  1. `Background parallax` 
Background parallax is the most popular use of the effect.
This use corresponds to the original idea, so when a visitor scrolls down a page, they can see the effect. 
Usually the site has a background image with parallax. Web designers like to place one parallax section in color,
one above and the other below. As a result, the illusion makes it look as if the static area opens and then covers
the image. 
    
  2. `Scroll paralax`
The idea is that the background images move more slowly relative to the virtual camera than the foreground images, 
which creates the illusion of two-dimensional depth of the scene. Parallax scrolling can be both standard, vertical 
and horizontal, and with a changing direction. 3. mouse parallax The mouse parallax effect is based on the position 
of the mouse cursor in the area of the slider. This creates an illusion of depth for the layers visible on the current 
slide. For example, your cursor enters the slider and the layers begin to move relative to the cursor.
