1. Why change and input events occurs on input (type="text")?
    1. **change event**
    
        For `<input type="text">`, the change event doesn't fire until the control loses focus.
        For example, while you are typing something in the text field below, there is no event.
        But as soon as you move the focus to another element, for example, press a button,
        the on exchange event will occur.
    2. **input event**
    
        Fired at controls when the user changes the value
        
       ```html
        <input type="text">
       <script>
        let 
        </script>
        ```
