# WhatIs: Vibration feedback
 
If you don't know what tactile communication is, it's the mechanical vibrations or movements that your device makes to 
notify you of a change in the state of the device, or to confirm that the user's actions are affecting the device. 
Tactile feedback is a very important factor for efficient and comfortable work with the device.

There are several cases of vibration feedback:

* Alert the owner of an incoming call, if the call has to be turned off (please turn off the phones in the theater). 
* Feedback in games. When a user is playing an exciting game, he or she needs to show some realism of what is happening 
* pulling the trigger, colliding with an obstacle, etc. 
* Vibrating notifications in case of an important change on the page, for example, when a new message appears in the web-chat.
* Duplication of sound signals if they are present in the interface, for example, to provide accessibility for users 
with hearing impairments (both physical impairments and simply muted sound on the device).
* Using vibration when interacting with interface elements in the application. It will be easier for the user to work 
with the program, feeling the tips of his fingers pressing the buttons of the graphical interface.
* when typing blindly on the keyboard. So, the importance of touch sensations becomes noticeable when using projective 
keyboards, because the user knocks his fingers on a hard surface and does not experience impacts and misses on the keys. 

## The benefits of vibration feedback

Audio feedback is one way to provide the user with semantic information about the object he or she is touching. 
However, audio feedback is not always an appropriate form of feedback. This is because the user may want to interact 
with applications in silence. 
An alternative way to provide tactile feedback on touch-screen devices is to use tactile vibration When the user touches
objects on the screen, such as a button, web link, or a line list item, the vibration motor built into the device is activated. 
This helps the user to understand whether or not it touches an object. However, unlike auditory feedback, this basic 
form of tactile feedback does not help the user to identify the object they are touching. Although different vibration 
patterns (e.g. different rhythms or different force levels) may be used to transmit some semantic information, the
touchscreen devices do not have the necessary information due to lack of tactile feedback. When the volume of the image
is felt and touched at the moment of tactile contact with the surface of a solid smooth screen, there is a vibration 
of the surface with different amplitudes.
