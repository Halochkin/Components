# Gestures
  Our hands are a great tool for communication with people and the environment. With our hands we can create something beautiful, 
show our emotions (raised thumb up), and even decide the fate of other people (lowered thumb down, in the Roman Empire or on Facebook).
Some time ago, technology allowed us to manipulate information with our hands. 
Using gestures to control mobile devices has become a daily activity. Push-button mobile devices are a thing of the past. Even my grandmother uses the phone's touch screen.
Now all the power of communication is in our hands.
But to show the maximum potential of mobile devices with touch screens, we need to explore a way to communicate with these devices.
And it is quite simple: gestures.

This repository contains all the basic gestures that are used on mobile devices:
* [`DragFling`](https://github.com/Halochkin/Components/tree/master/Gestures/DragFlingMixin) - adds support for one-finger gesture 
for `drag` on the screen, commonly used to move and/or scroll elements on the screen and a`fling` gesture which is triggered when 
the finger is removed from the screen while in motion, the dragging ends abruptly (Similar to the 
[`Drag-and-drop`](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop) event).
* [`PinchSpin`](https://github.com/Halochkin/Components/tree/master/Gestures/PinchGestureMixin) adds support for for two finger gestures such as:
  - pinch (used to for example zoom-out or shrink)<br>
  - expand (used to for example zoom-in or grow)<br>
  - rotate (used to... rotate)<br>
  - two-finger-drag (used to move a subselection of a page, when single-finger-drag is used to navigate the page as a whole)<br>
  - spin (used to trigger animations)<br>
