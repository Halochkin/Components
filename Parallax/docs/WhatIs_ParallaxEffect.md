# WhatIs: ParallaxEffect

 Parallax is a change in the visible position of the object relative to the remote background, depending on the observer's 
 position. 
 The principle of action of the parallax effect is based on how the brain determines the size of the object that 
 is in the field of view of a person. The closer the object is, the more it seems. Conversely, the further away the object
  is from us, the smaller it is. This is a basic description of how the brain perceives the perspective, and the parallax 
is a change in the visible position of the object relative to the distant background, depending on the observer's position.
 For example, when you are inside a fast-paced car or train, the objects that are closer to you move faster, while the
  objects that are farther away are slower. Although, in fact, their speed is the same. Along with other optical tricks, 
  perspective and parallax play an important role in the perception of the world, allowing you to understand and organize 
  the visual signals recorded by the eyes. Combined with the scrolling of the site, the parallax effect can have a 
  tremendous visual impact, especially when combined with some form of storytelling, which immerses you in the unusual
world of the company and carries you on a journey. 

>Many people confuse the parallax effect with the modern features of HTML5. That is, HTML5 allows you to create a motion
effect by emulating animation, while the parallax complements this action by shifting the object relative to the visible 
point, and with the help of scrolling, our eye perceives it as a three-dimensional effect. To do this, the layout is 
divided into backgrounds and individual images, and then the parallax allows them to move at different speeds, creating
a sense of depth and size. Focusing on a good story plays an important role in ensuring attention and uniqueness, and 
the effect transforms it into a creative story that you write.
       


### Perception of parallax effect

The effect is perfect for any type of site, whether it is an online store or a real estate company site due to the fact 
that an interesting interaction with the user is created. He becomes interested in looking at a long and informative, 
beautiful page, and the owner of the resource gets conversion, possible interest in services and other, and so on.
The good thing about parallax is that it does not need to be used on every page of one site.  Usually, it is enough 
only on the home to apply it, in order to attract the attention of visitors and convince them to view and study the 
internal pages and the main content.

If we consider the parallax effect in terms of the impact of the design on the user, it is he who creates the depth and
sense of distance between the elements, allowing you to feel that the blocks are literally floating in three-dimensional
dimension, and therefore, the user is in their environment, somewhere inside the design. In other words, something 
magical and incredibly beautiful is created on the screen and the user becomes a part of all this magic.

The combination of complexity of technical implementation and demanding resources with ambiguity of assessment by users 
and apparent redundancy prevents the penetration of technology into the broader context of web development - parallax
remains effective and creative, but not everywhere appropriate "design solution". The most adequate field of application
of parallax scrolling remains single-page promo-sites containing a small amount of content and needing to create a
memorable external image.

### Advantages of the parallax effect 

 #### Sensitive pathway
Parallax and especially the scrolling effect of parallax can do a lot of things and, in particular, can have a strong 
effect on the emotions of visitors.  For example, the effect allows the viewer to be guided through the history or on 
the time scale. You can not just see the parallax, but interact with it, with the site as a whole, see the calculation 
of altitude above sea level, look beyond the mountain ranges by moving the cursor and more.

#### When design matters
Such a solution is perfect for so-called one-page sites and resources that provide a minimum of information, such as
only a description of activities or contacts and location. When using parallax scrolling site even with a small amount
of content will be bright, attracting attention and causing interest.
In addition, the game with three-dimensional space in which the visitor gets, not only will be remembered, but also will
help to stand out among the competitors.




### Disadvantages of the parallax effect 

#### Preload images
The more parallax you have on the site, the more images you need. The more images (of high quality) and large size, the
longer the site is loaded on the user's side. In order not to overload neither the site, nor the traffic to the visitor 
is more convenient to initially provide the loading of images, and then allow the script to perform the animation effect.
This means that the user will have to wait for some time. It is important to note that the user should not think that 
your site does not work. Therefore, in such cases it is very important to add a progress bar to the download.

#### Mobility
Every year users increasingly use mobile devices.  But the parallax effect, which is created by scrolling the page, does 
not work on them. Therefore, you will have to create an alternative option or abandon the idea. For example, some sites
 simply do not display the necessary graphic information or do not open at all, when 
the usual browser on the PC or tablet, everything will work.








# Old
Parallax effect and parallax-scrolling will be popular in web design for a considerable amount of time. What exactly 
to use - to decide the webmaster and the customer. But anyway, to use the ready-made parallax-animation is always 
convenient and possible, because the attention of visitors attracts the effect and causes no less impression than a 
normal photo.

The main thing is to imagine and understand the essence of the effect; to understand what "parallax" means and how it 
is realized. Then it remains to decompose the objects into layers and set the desired speed for the objects. Which one 
and how? The designer's fantasy is back in business. Another variant of design style, which simply makes webmasters 
fantasize and play with speeds, objects, effects.
